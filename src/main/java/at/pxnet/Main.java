        // they have at least one "5" or at least three "4" in their grades. If a person does not have at least two
        // grades, the method throws an IllegalStateException, regardless of the grades

        // Create a class "University" in the at.pxnet package.
        // It should only have the default constructor
        // The class provides three Methods:
        // * "addStudent" takes a Person as a parameter and add them as a new student to the university
        // * "removeStudent" takes a Person as a parameter and removes them from the list
        // * "getStudents" returns a List of Persons. The list must be unmodifiable
        // * "getFailingStudents" returns a List of Persons. The list must be unmodifiable
        //
        // An additional method "getAverageAge" does not take any parameters and returns the average age of the
        // students (double). If no students are enlisted in the university, "0" is returned.
